		    <p class="pp">Northeastern Men&#39s Ultimate is a program on the rise. We trace our roots to just a few short years ago in 1998 when we were first founded as the NU Gentleman&#39s Club, nearly 20 years after most New England regional teams. Despite our relatively brief existence, and perhaps in spite of it, we have quickly established ourselves as a strong team with a lot to prove. </p>
		    <p class="pp">Over recent years we have traveled across the country to places such as: Austin, Santa Barbara, Atlanta, to play against other top-tier college teams. As our national presence grows, so does our desire to earn a place at college nationals, the holy grail of college Ultimate.</p>
		    <p class="pp">On the field we are a group of fiercely competitive and hardworking individuals, but off the field we are a family. We take classes together, look out for each other and some of us even live together.</p>
		    <p class="pp">Maybe you played in high school, maybe you&#39re the kind of person who wants to try something new, or maybe you just love the thought of flying across the country and representing your school.</p>
		    <p class="pp">We won&#39t ask why you joined, we&#39ll just be happy to have you and your passion for the game.</p>
